### Social Network Analysis


Social Network Analysis is the study of social structures utilizing networks and graph theory. It defines network-connected systems in terms of their nodes (independent actors, people, or things) and their connections (relationships or interactions). With the help of SNA, marketers can gain insightful data for developing communication and branding strategies.


The main focus of this project will be social media networks, mainly LinkedIn. Today, approximately 11.7 percent of the global population is active on LinkedIn. Marketers can reach around 849.6 million users with LinkedIn ads which makes Linkedin one of the world’s largest social media platforms. This project’s goal is to develop an SNA tool that will aid in the identification of influencers, anchors, etc., for use in future marketing campaigns, digital marketing strategies, and SEO initiatives. Visualizing social networks can help to identify network structure, the average length and possible directions for information spread, and the most influential people through whom most people can be reached.
